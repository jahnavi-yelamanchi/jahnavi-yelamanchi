Hi! I’m a computer engineering graduate student and a Graduate Researcher at the General Purpose Robotics and AI Lab (GRAIL) at NYU’s CILVR Group with Prof. Lerrel Pinto.

Other experiences of mine include researching efficient model inference at the System & Artificial Intelligence (SAI) Lab with Prof. Sai Zhang, working on multilingual representation learning at the National University of Singapore with Prof. Liu Lili, and leading robotics control work as part of the IIT Bombay E-Yantra Robotics initiative.

I also hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science Engineering, where I explored reinforcement learning and NLP.
